This thesis explores the evolution of video games through the prism of the impact of human, material and creative resources. As technological advances have enabled the creation of increasingly complex and resource-intensive games, video games have transformed from a marginal creative practice into a globalized and lucrative industry. The analysis highlights the effects of this growth on production dynamics, standardization of development, and dependence on complex technologies. Through a comparative study of Starfield and Outer Wilds, two recent games with opposing design philosophies, this dissertation examines dominant industry practices and the alternatives emerging in the independent field. The chapters deal successively with the intensive extraction of human and natural resources, then with the possibilities for creative reappropriation of design processes, advocating subtractive design approaches and more sustainable videogame experiences. By integrating historical, sociological and political perspectives, the aim is to question the sustainability of a model based on “techno-industrial glorification” and to propose avenues for more responsible and innovative video game design.

Memristor is a transmedia project that explores a technological dystopia through multiple artistic mediums, including short film, set photography, comics, Augmented reality, interactive software and 3D modeling. At its core, the project immerses us in a cold, oppressive ghost city shaped by metallic, electronic architecture, a fictional archive drawn from walks through unsettling, brutalist urban landscapes. The short film uses video-inlay techniques to place a live-action character within a fully modeled 3D environment, with visual inspirations from comic books, early 3D video games, and science fiction cinema, reinforcing a sense of alienation and dystopia. Parallel to this, the project includes a photographic series and a comic strip built from the same 3D models, allowing nonlinear storytelling through different visual languages. Through these varied media, Memristor constructs a layered narrative world that questions the impact of unchecked architectural growth ,the future of our urban environments and the impact of artificial intelligence technologies on our human relationships.


Made in unreal engine, feelings festival is a 3D short film that attempts to convey my feelings as a person with emotional and auditory hypersensitivity during a live performance. The viewer sees a shape-shifting creature dancing to the rhythm of the music, taking the form of the emotions running through him. As the show progresses, the audience moves closer to the stage, isolating themselves in a face-to-face space with the creature, becoming more and more emotionally involved. At the end of the show, the sudden deafening applause disturbs both the viewer and the creature, causing it to deform in pain.


Save the goblin is an AR video game using machine learning as controllers. Simply scan the various posters to reveal the puzzles to be solved. There are two ways of solving the puzzles: on your own by memorising the sequences or by asking someone else for help. The player then has to make the corresponding moves in the magic box to free one of their companions.
In the heart of the Forêhead, the mage Macintox has held sway over the goblins for several millennia. He uses them for evil purposes... Your companions Int, Bool, Var and Float have fallen into his traps. Free them with the power of Cheatmove, which only you possess. Can you outwit the great magician’s labyrinths?

Locked in with a Ghost is a virtual escape game set in a moody marine environment. The goal is to find the various clues to solve puzzles and exit the room. There are a variety of gameplay approaches and puzzle designs. The narrative is supported by a friendly ghost who talks to you throughout your journey.
The main objectives with this short project were to start from the simple prompt of making an escape game, to have room to think about many design aspects that interest me: the environmental narrative, the puzzle design, and the art direction. It was also an opportunity for me to really put together in a game the technical tools and knowledge I had acquired on other projects (texturing, integration, code, modeling...).


Taskmaster operates as a critical examination of how labor, particularly within the AI industry, is often rendered invisible and under-evaluated. Drawing on concepts from game design and platform studies, the project illustrates how gamification can mask exploitative practices behind engaging and seemingly innocuous interfaces. By simulating real-world microtasks and data annotation processes within a fast-paced, reward-oriented environment, the game prompts players to confront how digital systems commodify cognitive effort and attention. Serving both as an experiential game and an analytical lens, Taskmaster exposes the blurred boundaries between play and work, while also exploring the use of dark design patterns that drive user compliance and persistence.
"Welcome to the ultimate challenge! Fast, fun and dangerously addictive, Taskmaster offers a series of vibrant micro-tasks that test your memory, precision and speed. Whether you're aiming for a high score or just passing the time, there's always another round waiting for you. Simple to learn but hard to master, it will certainly put your skills to the test. If the game starts to feel familiar, even a bit like work, don't worry: that just means you’re in the flow. The best players stay focused, keep clicking, and trust the system. Every task, no matter how mundane or disturbing, feeds your development. Ultimately, only players with enough persistence will find their balance. Sometimes dedication is needed to make real progress and reap the rewards of your hard work."


Developed for the 2025 International Exhibition of the Swiss Pavilion and showcased in Osaka, Johanna Spyrit is a VR experience that invites visitors into the imaginative mind of Johanna Spyri, author of Heidi, as she begins writing the novel in 1886.
Will the first page always be the same? Suspended above a mountain of paper, the visitor is faced with a “Blank Page”, a dreamlike, empty world where characters emerge in their hands. By listening to them and making narrative and meaningful choices, visitors shape the environment, generating a unique, animated and evolving landscape. Each path taken creates new visual and narrative possibilities.

The experience explores the power of creative choices and how they influence the meaning and impact of artistic works. It also touches on central themes from Heidi: the contrast between nature and urban life, tradition and modernity, and how these tensions continue to resonate today.


In a design fiction approach, Symbiosis envisions a future of democracy where citizens, living beings, and open source AI models collaborate to tackle the challenges of tomorrow. In this installation, you embody a Swiss citizen in the year 2050. By scanning the different artifacts within the installation, you contribute to the database of the "Maire de Terre," an AI totem that proposes laws and helps the population address major ecological and digital issues based on human-curated data and situations. Based on the reintegration of electronic waste and mycelial networks, this installation is made of recycled digital objects and living organic matter. The project was developed in collaboration with the Graduate Institute in Geneva, was exhibited in Geneva in 2024 and is currently exhibited in Bern until 2026.

Made in collaboration with Axel Nowak (@maxelhi), Stackace (name not definitive) is a narrative boss-rush deckbuilder videogame set in a desolate, dreamlike world ruled by ancient giants. Stack cards to create powerful synergies, outsmart your enemies, and uncover the intertwined stories of two protagonists. Right under you can find the trailer of our very first proof-of-concept demo that features a single boss fight showcasing the core combat mechanics with very basic cards, art direction, and atmosphere of the project. Some bits are still written in french tho, sorry! If you want to try the demo, it is avaliable on my itch.io page; if you do so, don't hesitate to write me or axel to give feedbacks! More to come!
